#+TITLE: Representation Learning with Torch

It is easier to use a docker container built from =/docker/torch=.
We provide a base image with =ubuntu= and its latest =gcc-6=.

An existing docker image can be located at [[https://hub.docker.com/r/phissenschaft/torch7/][phissenschaft/torch7:latest]]. 
Or running =./bin/th= will do.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Pull the latest version from dockerhub
  docker run -it -e LOCAL_USER_ID="$(id -u "$USER")" -v "$PWD":/tmp/host phissenschaft/torch7:latest
#+END_SRC


The build is carried out in three steps. 
1. Build a =ubuntu= base image with =gcc= support.
   It might be desirable to use =gcc-5= to support latest =CUDA= toolkits.
2. Build libraries from source using [[http://linuxbrew.sh][linuxbrew]] (or with our [[https://github.com/darthsuogles/build_scripts][collection of build scripts]]).
3. Build =torch= from the latest [[https://github.com/torch/distro][distro]]. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Build base image with gcc (from ubuntu)
  cd docker/base/gcc-6 && docker build -t toolchain:gcc-6

  # Build image with dependencies compiled from linuxbrew
  cd docker/torch/deps && docker build -t torch-deps

  # Build torch itself
  cd docker/torch && docker build -t torch7
#+END_SRC

Everything else is built from source with =linuxbrew=.
