#+TITLE: Representation Learning

It is easier to use a docker container built from =/docker/torch=.
We provide a base image with =ubuntu= and its latest =gcc-6=.
Everything else is built from source with =linuxbrew=.

We use the ~distro~ version of ~torch~. 
It is constantly updated and we are quite happy with the default setting.
One caveat is that it requires setting =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= to work correctly.
If certain library is missing in run-time, =th= might not be able to 
report a very meaningful error message. 
Setting =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= (to point to an existing installation) 
and reinstalling some packages (=torch=) will result in strange failures. 

When strange things happen, try using =luajit -l libtorch= to see 
detailed error messages. It is usually related to the dynamic loader not
being able to find the right libraries. 

Notice that in =OSX=, the =threads= package does not work.
